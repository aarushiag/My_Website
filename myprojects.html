					<h1>My Projects</h1>
					<h2>Development of Currency Conversion Application using Python</h2>
					<p>
					Under this project an application was developed to convert one currency to another currency. The application usage a web service to provide current conversion rate.
					This application is developed in such a way so as to handle various erroneous inputs situations and hence it is a robust application. Code was written in an optimal way so that application performance is very fast.
					Overall it is a easy to use Application.					
					</p>
					<h2>Development of Air Pollution Detector using Arduino Kit</h2>
					<p>
					A device was developed using Arduino kit to determine Air pollution.Our sensor focuses on the five components of the Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality Index: ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. This device detects all of these pollutants except sulfur dioxide. It was a team work and my role was to develop hardware of the needed detector.
					This project was very useful in giving me insight of various hardware related aspects.I learnt a lot during this project.
